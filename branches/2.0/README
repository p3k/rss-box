JavaScript RSS Box Viewer 2.0
=============================

The JavaScript RSS Box Viewer was coded in Rebol and JavaScript by Tobi Schaefer 
between 2001 and 2008.

The author cannot be held responsible for any uncomfortable situation caused by 
the code. This means: sorry, no warranty for anything. It's just code but I 
like it. If you do not that's your problem. You have been warned.

Same applies to the following ultra-short guide on how to install the script on 
your own server:

1) Download the Rebol executable from http://rebol.com and install it at the 
   place of your choice.

2) You need a web server enabled to run Rebol scripts via the Common Gateway 
   Interface (CGI). I recommend Apache [http://httpd.apache.org] because all 
   you have to configure is:

   AddHandler cgi-script .r
   
   (But be aware that this is a too simple and pretty insecure setup, only 
   acceptable as a quick start.)

3) Get the JavaScript RSS Box Viewer script and everything else necessary via 
   Subversion (SVN). There are many SVN clients out there, some even have a 
   pretty graphical interface. However, for the command line approach you might 
   want to use only something like this:

   svn co http://p3k.org/svn/rss-box/branches/2.0/ rss-box

4) If you are on a *nix box check the permission settings of the script and its 
   environment. The web server needs to execute the script and the files should
   already come with the correct permissions. If you are not sure if the 
   settings are correct something like the following should do the job:

   chown -R www-data rss-box
   chmod 755 rss-box/proxy.r
   chmod 755 rss-box/referrers.r

   If you use a different system you should rather ask your system 
   administrator. (That's the technically skilled person you either pay or 
   should have paid a lot of money to help you using your full-featured 
   proprietary software.)

5) Set the she-bang (ie. the first line of the script starting with "#")
   in the index.r script to the path of your Rebol installation.

6) Set the base-uri variable in the proxy.r script to the base URI of
   where your script will be located at.

7) Point your browser to this URI and cross your fingers.

Have Fun!
